# IPV-NS
## **Current status of research on IPV**
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), more simply "domestic violence", is the physical/sexual
violence, stalking, or psychological harm perpetrated by a current or former partner/spouse.
IPV affects 15â€“71% of women over their lifetime, resulting in significant stress, adverse health,
and economic effects. During the COVID-19 pandemic, IPV dramatically increased due
to mandatory stay-at-home requirements. IPV can lead to acute injuries, traumatic brain
injuries, unintended pregnancy, but also to chronic conditions, such as headaches, pelvic pain,
dysmenorrhea, sexual dysfunction, irritable bowel syndrome, insomnia, depression, anxiety
disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cognitive decline. 
In this fluid and evolving scenario, a systematic analysis of the literature is still missing 
to reveal which issues related to IPV have been addressed and which ones are still obscure.

## **PROJECT GOAL**
This project aims to do a systematic review of the IPV research status exploiting the potential
of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Network science tools. We wish to achieve
a complete overview of the subjects where the research is focusing on through a semantic
analysis of thousands of articles. From this analysis we can discover the topics less covered
and the central ones at the moment. We want to study the correlation between topics, identify
which aspects of the research are more connected and which one tends to be isolated. Looking
at the outliers topics we can suggest the new aspects that future research should take in
consideration. Furthermore we want to propose a temporal analysis of the evolution of the
research in general, of the specific topics and of the correlations between topics. Particularly
the temporal analysis of the correlations shows if, over the years, the topics tend to connect
more between each others. More interconnection between topics means that the papers do
not treat of a specific sector but consider different aspects simultaneously.
